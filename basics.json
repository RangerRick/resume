    "summary": "I am a software developer, musician, and tech polymath, and I have been interested in computers and software since childhood. I enjoy learning new technologies and applying that knowledge to the development of good software, whether it's backend, frontend, or full-stack. I have a wide breadth of knowledge, but I'm not afraid to do a deep dive on a subject to get the job done. I have worked in and around open-source software for many years, and have contributed to many projects and communities.",
